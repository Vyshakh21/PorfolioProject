
COVID-19 Demographic Impact Analysis
Project Overview
This project analyzes the impact of COVID-19 on different demographic groups using SQL. The goal is to explore how factors like age, gender, pre-existing health conditions, and geographic location influenced infection rates, hospitalizations, and mortality during the pandemic. By querying and processing large datasets, the project aims to uncover trends and disparities in COVID-19 outcomes across various population groups.

Key Objectives
Explore the relationship between demographic factors (age, gender, health conditions) and COVID-19 outcomes (infection rate, hospitalization, mortality).
Identify vulnerable populations and geographic areas most affected by COVID-19.
Use SQL queries to aggregate, filter, and visualize data to derive meaningful insights.
Data Sources
The project uses publicly available COVID-19 datasets, which include demographic data such as age, gender, underlying health conditions, and region of residence.
Data is retrieved from reliable sources such as government health organizations and research institutions.
Technologies Used
SQL: For querying, filtering, and aggregating large datasets.
Data Visualization Tools (optional): To visualize trends and insights (e.g., Excel, Tableau, or any other preferred visualization tool).
Key SQL Techniques
Joins: Combining multiple tables to gather comprehensive demographic and COVID-19 outcome data.
GROUP BY: Aggregating data by age, gender, region, and other demographic factors.
FILTERING: Refining data to focus on specific demographic groups or regions.
HAVING: Setting conditions for groups after aggregation to highlight significant trends.
